# Third-party asset notices

## dsh-pet

The pet media assets (WebM animations, preview GIFs and `config.jsonc`) are **no
longer bundled or downloaded** by this package. The preset pet catalog
(`src-tauri/resources/preset-pets.json`) only registers the remote URLs, and the
pet window streams them directly from
[`PC2005-cloud/dsh-pet`](https://github.com/PC2005-cloud/dsh-pet) at play time
(macOS reads the HEVC-alpha `.mov` mirror from
[`dsh-tauri-desk/dsh-pet-mov`](https://github.com/dsh-tauri-desk/dsh-pet-mov)).
The catalog pins specific commits for reproducibility:

| Source | Pinned commit |
| --- | --- |
| `PC2005-cloud/dsh-pet` | `e1ff8c1e4001878cbb80441262d530e16541f138` |
| `dsh-tauri-desk/dsh-pet-mov` | `be0f3bb494cb71a4c73f916c0b92d25a3ab4d002` |

`dsh-tauri-desk/dsh-pet-mov` is our own re-encode of the upstream transparent
WebM clips into the HEVC-with-Alpha (`.mov`) form WKWebView can decode with
alpha; it carries no separate artwork.

## dsh-dafeiyu

No assets from [`QCYTSN/dsh-dafeiyu`](https://github.com/QCYTSN/dsh-dafeiyu)
(the BigFish sprite set or its `legacy/` archive) are bundled, downloaded or
redistributed by this package. That repository is referenced for **text and
status-priority behaviour only** — see
[`docs/sync-log.md`](./docs/sync-log.md) for the adopted derivation. Its own art
was replaced upstream in `v0.1.10` by assets imported from `PC2005-cloud/dsh-pet`,
which are covered by the section above.
